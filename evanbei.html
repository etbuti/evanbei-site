    <h2>Research Focus</h2>
    <p>
      Evan Bei is an independent scholar working at the intersection of sound studies, time-based practice, and conceptual research.
      His work approaches sound not as a fixed object or representational medium, but as an event shaped by temporal decision,
      embodiment, and contextual conditions.
    </p>

    <h2>Core Project</h2>
    <p><strong>Sound as Event</strong> is a long-term research project that develops a conceptual framework for understanding sound as an occurrence rather than an object.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Breath as Event — embodied conditions of initiation (whether sound may occur)</li>
      <li>Pulse as Event — temporal decision structures (when sound may occur)</li>
      <li>Voice as Event — execution and presence (who/what performs the sound)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Selected Papers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Breath as Event</strong> — <em>Organised Sound</em> (under review)</li>
      <li><strong>Pulse as Event: Temporal Decision Structures in Sound-Based Practice</strong> — <em>Leonardo</em> (under review)</li>
      <li><strong>Voice as Event</strong> — manuscript completed (submission planned)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Book Project</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Sound as Event: Time, Decision, and Embodied Execution in Sound-Based Practice</strong><br/>
      Research monograph in preparation. Proposal completed; publisher inquiries in progress.

    <h2>Short Bio (100 words)</h2>
    <p>
      Evan Bei is an independent scholar whose work explores sound as a temporally situated event rather than as a fixed object or representational medium.
      His research focuses on conditions of sound occurrence, including embodiment, temporal decision, and execution.
      His current project, <em>Sound as Event</em>, develops a conceptual framework through applied studies on breath, pulse, and voice,
      offering a non-representational approach to sound-based practice across experimental music, sound art, and interdisciplinary contexts.

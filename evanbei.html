    <h2>Research Focus</h2>
    <p>
      Evan Bei is an independent researcher working at the intersection of sound studies, time-based practice, and conceptual research.
      The work approaches sound not as a fixed object or representational medium, but as an event articulated through temporal decision,
      embodied conditions, and contextual relations.
    </p>

    <h2>Core Project</h2>
    <p><strong>Sound as Event</strong> is a long-term research project developing a conceptual framework for understanding sound in event-based terms rather than as an object.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Breath as Event — embodied conditions of initiation (the conditions under which sound may occur)</li>
      <li>Pulse as Event — temporal decision structures (the temporal logic by which sound may occur)</li>
      <li>Voice as Event — execution and presence (the agencies through which sound occurs)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Short Bio</h2>
    <p>
      Evan Bei is an independent researcher whose work examines sound as a temporally situated event. 
      The research focuses on embodiment, temporal decision, and execution as conditions through which sound emerges. 
      The ongoing project <em>Sound as Event</em> develops a conceptual framework through studies on breath, pulse, and voice, 
      proposing a non-representational approach to sound-based practice across experimental music, sound art, and interdisciplinary contexts.
